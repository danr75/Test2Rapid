This directory is for audio files used in the application.

For the 10-Minute AI Catch-up feature, you would need to add an audio file named "ai-catchup.mp3" here.
The audio should be a summary of the latest AI developments and trends, formatted as a brief podcast-style update.

Note: Since this is a prototype, the actual audio file is not included. In a production environment, 
you would either:
1. Upload a pre-recorded audio file here
2. Generate the audio dynamically using a text-to-speech service
3. Stream the audio from an external source
