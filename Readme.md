# Interactive Learning Hub

## Purpose

Build an AI-powered interactive learning application. Users enter a topic to learn, answer AI-generated questions, receive instant feedback, and visually build a mind map of mastered concepts.

This repository is structured to allow fast iterative prototyping with AI-assisted development. All files are designed to instruct Windsurf AI with clear step-by-step atomic tasks.

## Key Functional Requirements

- Topic input via search/chat interface.
- Auto-generated multiple-choice questions (MCQ) using GPT-4 or equivalent.
- 3 answer options: 1 correct, 2 incorrect.
- Instant feedback after each answer:
  - Correct: green box + short learning tip (max 30 words).
  - Incorrect: red box + short explanation (max 30 words).
- Continuous question generation that builds upon previous answers.
- Live mind map visualization that adds nodes for correct answers.
- Users can click nodes to review learning tips.
- Fully responsive UI for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Clean, simple, modern interface following provided visual reference.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Fast load time and smooth transitions.
- Scalable backend.
- Modular code structure for easy feature addition.
- Use GPT-4 or equivalent for question generation.
- Store user progress and mind map state.

## Tech Stack

- Optimized for no-code/low-code/AI-agent development.
- Specific implementation decisions will occur during task execution.
