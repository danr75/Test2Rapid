# System Requirements

## Core Principles

- **Modular Design**: Each component should be self-contained with clear interfaces
- **AI-First Approach**: Leverage AI capabilities for content generation and adaptation
- **Minimal Code**: Use the simplest implementation that meets requirements
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Focus on quick iterations with testable functionality
- **User Experience**: Prioritize clean, intuitive interfaces

## Technical Requirements

- **Frontend**: React.js with Next.js framework
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **API Integration**: OpenAI API for question generation
- **Visualization**: D3.js for mind map rendering
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux for application state
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests

## Development Guidelines

- Always write clean, commented code
- Implement error handling for all API calls
- Ensure responsive design works on all screen sizes
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Document all components and functions
- Use TypeScript for type safety where appropriate

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize API calls to minimize tokens used
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Ensure mind map visualization remains performant as it grows
- Lazy load components when possible to improve initial load time
